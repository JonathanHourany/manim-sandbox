# Manim Sandbox
The [Manim Project](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/index.html)

Testing grounds for various Manim projects.

To run an animation:
```bash
manim -pqh tutorials/quickstart/basic_scene.py CreateCircle
```
The `-p` flag plays the animation once it's rendered.
The `-q` flag is "quality", and can be `-ql`, `-qm`, `-qh` or `-qk` for low, medium, high, and 4k quality respectively.
